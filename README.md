# Combinatorial games

Project carried out in the subject of combinatorial games with [alexmal01](https://github.com/alexmal01) and [@jakub-piw](https://github.com/jakub-piw).

**Szemeredi's game**

At the beginning of the game, the computer draws an x-element set of natural numbers. Each player has his own color. The move is to select an uncolored number from the set and color it with their color. Players try to arrange a monochromatic arithmetic sequence of a given length k. The player who arranges such a sequence first wins. A game of man versus computer.
